<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p>This is a simple hangman game . It was written in Javascript, without any libraries or APIs (not even jQuery). To play, just guess a letter by typing your guess on your keyboard. If you guess incorrectly 9 times, you lose. If you guess the word before that happens, you win. After you win or lose, you can restart the game by pressing any key on the keyboard.</p>
